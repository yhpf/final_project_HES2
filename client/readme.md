# Assignment #6 - Angular

## Basic Angular Application
This is a very basic Angular application.

### Comment: Structure
The additional component with ngFor repeats the todo-cards.

### Comments: Functionality
- I'm showing a very basic version of my todo-cards from my Express application. 
- I'm getting data to the cards from my REST API in the Express app (the Todo app that is up and running on DO for Assignment 5 http://167.172.150.105:8081/index). In other words: You can add a new todo item in the Express app and then you can reload the Angular app (Assignment 6) and the new todo item from the Express app will appear. If you delete an item in the Express app and reload the Angular app, the item will disapear from the Angular app as well. 
- The design is really ugly (I put 0 effort into this) and I'm wondering how to style so that repeating objects appear after each other on the same line, insted of after each other in the same column. So far I can't get "normal" CSS tricks to work.
