I need to fix in the future:
- fix stuff that were not good in the assignment 4 submission 
	- make attachment optional with help of an IF statement (nice-to-have)
	- time zone for dates (created, updated, deadline) (nice-to-have)
	- connect-flash error message. Not working properly. 
- link so that user can view attached file! (nice-to-have)
- make it possible to change the done status on the edit page (nice-to-have)

The Done boolean is not currently part of the API

### Testing the applications API
The Todo application also has a REST API. This API can be tested either via POSTMAN or a client-side test based on JS code. This assignment requires a client-side test based on JS code and this is available. The test interface can be found in the `index.html` file (in public folder), and the js code can be found in the `apitest.js` file (in public > js). Make sure to open the `index.html` as a file extension in your browser so that you get the cross-origin.
